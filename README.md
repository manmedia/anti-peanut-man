# anti-peanut-man
A fun exercise for AWS IAM Roles Java SDK

# Background
Anti-Peanut Man (APM) wants to eat some peanuts from an S3 bucket. However, APM has some peanut allergies :( 

As programmers we want to make sure that APM can eat peanuts (or  at least, see how many buckets of different peanuts are stored in s3), without having any allergic reaction to it. 

How can we help APM?

# Tips
1. We need APM to "Assume" that he could eat peanuts
2. "Sometimes.....", it's easier to think how we can make this happen? Instead of Googling away....../-\ -_-
3. It's simpler than we think :)
